# Hi, I'm Ellie 👋🏼

I'm a software engineer by trade and a story-teller at heart. I believe both technology and art have incredible capabilities to transform lives and uplift communities. I am passionate about equity within the tech industry for marginalized folks which led to me learn how to code at <a href="https://resilientcoders.org">Resilient Coders</a> and to lead an employee resource group at my previous company for bootcamp graduates. I aim to use my skills as a developer, content creator, and advocate to make resources more accessible for those who want to take a non-traditional path into coding AND how to do so sustainably (for both developers and employers).

### My Tech Stack and Skills:
HTML & CSS | JavaScript ES6 | React | Express | Node.js 
SQL & NoSQL | PHP | Java | BootStrap | Wordpress | Android Development

### Currently I'm working on:
- learning Python
- practicing data-structures and algorithms
- staying sane in the midst of a global pandemic
