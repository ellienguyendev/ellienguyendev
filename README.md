# Hi, I'm Ellie 👋🏼

<img src="github-banner.png" alt="banner that says Ellie Nguyen - software engineer, media producer and wellness advocate alongside a cartoon illustration of Ellie'">
I'm a software engineer by trade and a story-teller at heart. I believe both technology and art have incredible capabilities to transform lives and uplift communities. I am passionate about equity within the tech industry for marginalized folks which led to me learn how to code at <a href="https://resilientcoders.org">Resilient Coders</a> and to lead an employee resource group at my previous company for bootcamp graduates. I aim to use my skills as a developer, content creator, and advocate to make resources more accessible for those who want to take a non-traditional path into coding.
